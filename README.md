# GeoFSPortForWindows
A free flight simulator on the internet ported to Windows.
Based on GeoFS Desktop App by Jminding.
The original project was cancelled back in 2021.
I decided to revive this project after it was cancelled in 2021.
This port was limited to Windows because I don't use Linux, macOS.
If you want it to run on Linux or macOS, you should use a VM or Vine app for Linux.
To launch the app, you need to extract the .rar file and then run the exe file called WebApp.exe
